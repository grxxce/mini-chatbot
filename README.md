# Mini-Siri
Hello world! This is a "mini siri" program I put together with pure Python and OpenAI's Whisper and Chatbot APIs. The personality of the chatbot is completely programmable — see [Personalizing Mini-Siri](#-Personalizing-Mini-Siri)

I'm currently coding a frontend to make it more user friendly, but here are some startup instructions if you want to play with it yourself from the terminal!

# Installation
### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/grxxce/mini-chatbot.git
```

### Install the dependencies
```
npm install openai
npm install pyaudio
npm install wave
```
### Run the program
```
python3 chatbot.py  
```


# Personalizing Mini-Siri
Modify line 41 of chatbot.py
