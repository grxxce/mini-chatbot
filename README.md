# Mini-Siri
Hello world! This is a pure python "mini siri" program I made with OpenAI's Whisper API. The personality of the chatbot is completely programmable — see [Personalizing Mini-Siri](#-Personalizing-Mini-Siri)

I'm currently putting together a frontend to make it more user friendly, but here are some startup instructions if you want to play with it yourself from teh terminal!
